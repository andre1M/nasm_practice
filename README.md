# NASM little programs 

> Note: **stud_io.inc** is included to make macrodirectives work. This file is provided by [Andrey V. Stolyarov](http://www.stolyarov.info).

There are many similar repos out there, I am sure. This one is mine. All of it is inspired by [this book](http://stolyarov.info/books/programming_intro/vol2). Most of the code snippets are published in the code archive related to the aforementioned book. The only purpose of this repo is to practice NASM programming.
